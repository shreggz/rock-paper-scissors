# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple "rock, paper, scissors" game made with HTML/CSS/JS. A live version of the game is playable [here](https://shreggz.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/). It works fine on both desktop and mobile.

I built this as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The main purpose of this project was to learn about JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation. An earlier version of this game was played in the console, but this version is fully functional in the browser.

Cheers!
